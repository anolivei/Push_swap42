## About ##

- Push_swap is an algorithm project at school 42 and the instructions were given in the [subject](https://github.com/anolivei/Push_swap42/blob/main/en.subject.pdf).
- We start with two stacks called A and B.
- A is filled with some random integers (without duplicates) and B is empty.
- We can perform a limited set of instructions on these stacks and the goal is to sort all these integers using the lowest possible number of actions.
- The limited set of instructions are:

| Operation | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| `sa` | swap A - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A |
| `sb` | swap B - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B |
| `ss` | `sa` and `sb` at the same time |
| `pa` | push A - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of A |
| `pb` | push B - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of B |
| `ra` | rotate A - shift up all elements of stack A by 1. The first element becomes the last one |
| `rb` | rotate B - shift up all elements of stack B by 1. The first element becomes the last one |
| `rr` | `ra` and `rb` at the same time |
| `rra` | reverse rotate A - shift down all elements of stack A by 1. The last element becomes the first one |
| `rrb` | reverse rotate B - shift down all elements of stack B by 1. The last element becomes the first one |
| `rrr` | `rra` and `rrb` at the same time |
